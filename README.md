# makeperfect

**7/18/2015:**  Make Perfect is my capstone project for PDX Code Guild. When finished, it will allow musicians to organize their set lists, repertoire, performance/practice notes, and chord charts. Classical musicians will be able to store PDFs or .jpg files of pieces they are working on. Ultimately, this will be an app one can use with a tablet on a music stand during rehearsal. Musicians will be able to share set lists and performance notes with other musicians.
