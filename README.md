# makeperfect

Make Perfect is a single page Django app that allows musicians to organize lists of repertoire pieces, set lists for gigs, performance/practice notes, and chord/lyric charts. 


TO DO (as of 8/28/2015):

* deploy MVP to Amazon AWS (anticipated for the first week of September)

* fix login-error message so it's something other than an annoying alert

* add social media authorization or create mechanism for password retrieval

* make the width of the input fields responsive

* create option for users to save chord sheets and set lists as PDFs for printing

* find a good way to have the lyrics and chords print side-by-side so they can be useful when printed for a performance or rehearsal session

* setup a way for musicians to share setlists and/or song details with each other
